/**
 * Class representing an HTTP response message.  May be used
 * both to parse existing HTTP response into a comprehensible object, and to
 * construct new responses from scratch and print them out to a text string.
 * Makes no attempt to handle the body of the response -- only the response code
 * and the headers will be captured.
 *
 * If you're planning on servicing GET and HEAD requests only, you can use
 * the Create_standard_response() method to have a lot of headers automatically
 * set up for you.  The HTTP specification mandates these headers, and some
 * clients may expect them.
 *
 * Also see the HTTP_Message class for methods that can be used to query and
 * set the response headers.
