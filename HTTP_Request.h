/**
 * Class representing an HTTP request message.  May be used both
 * to parse an existing HTTP request into a comprehensible object, and to
 * construct new requests from scratch and print them out to a text string.
 * Makes no attempt to handle the body of the request -- only the request line
 * and the headers will be captured.
 *
 * If all you want to do is download a file, call create_GET_request() with
 * the path of the file that you want to download, and then call set_host()
 * on the returned object with the hostname of the server from which you'll
 * be downloading.  You should then be able to Print() the request out to a
 * character buffer to get something that the server will accept.
 *
 * Also see the HTTP_Message class for methods that can be used to query and
 * set the request's headers.
